## Spinosaurus Biomimicry Applications Lattice

1. Robotics: Paddle forelimbs + deep tail → amphibious locomotion (Optimus water ops, underwater drones)
   Efficiency gain: 30–50% in variable media

2. Aerospace: Neural sail → deployable radiators / morphing control surfaces
   Benefit: Passive cooling for Starship re-entry

3. Marine Energy: Tail undulation → oscillating hydrofoils for tidal generators
   Advantage: High performance in low-flow regimes

4. Sensors: Rostral pits → gradient pressure arrays for turbid navigation
   Application: Oil-spill cleanup, Mars subsurface probes

All under MIT—fork freely, attribute appreciated.
